<h2> About me </h2> 
<p>
I am a sixth year PhD student working under Professor Alireza Golsefidy at The University of California, San Diego. My mathematical interests lie in the applications of harmonic analysis, group theory, information theory and number theory towards the study of Random Walks on profinite groups. My computer science interests lie in the application of SMT solvers and Functional Programming towards solving pure math problems.

I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position.
